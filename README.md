# pneumonia_detection
A basic neural network to classify digit create and train a convolutional neural network (CNN) for a binary classification task using TensorFlow and Keras.  

In order to to run this neural network model, either copy the code from the raw file or simply, download the "Worked_pneumonia_detection" file and open it in Google Colab. Then, run it to execute the cells sequentially.
